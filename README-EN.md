# Tetris with Gravity Physics

## Overview

Developed by Tegar Umar Abdillah, NPM 230621002, this version of Tetris introduces a unique twist to the classic game by incorporating gravity physics. This innovative approach not only challenges players to think strategically about how they place their Tetriminos but also simulates a more realistic environment where gravity affects the movement and alignment of the pieces.

## How to Play

1. **Movement:** Use the arrow keys to move the Tetriminos left or right.
2. **Rotation:** Press the up arrow to rotate the Tetriminos, aligning them to fit into rows.
3. **Speed Up:** Press the down arrow to increase the Tetriminos' fall speed, challenging your reaction time under gravity's influence.
4. **Pause:** Press 'P' to pause the game and take a break.
